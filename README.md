# Krabby Patty Clicker
With the power of programming and childrens cartoons on my side, I have created a cookie clicker with my own fun little twist on it. </br>

## Beginning
One of the toughest parts of the assignment, was getting started on it. I tried to split the assignment into little, *less intimidating* tasks.
I started working on it as follows:

* Git (gud)
  * Created a repository on github and added a .gitignore file, this project I actually used a .gitignore file for the first time.
  * Cloned that repository on my computer
  * Created all necessary files and folders
* HTML:
  * Create the base HTML template and adding all the basic HTML tags to get started
    * A button for the clicker
    * A label where you can see how many clicks are present
* Javascript: 
  * The variable amount of clicks on the button

#### I disregarded CSS for most of the beginning, because I believed I would be switching a lot of back and forth in the names of different HTML tags.
